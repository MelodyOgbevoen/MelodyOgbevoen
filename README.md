##  My Creative Approach to Data

✨ I don’t just analyse data — I design experiences around it.  
✨ I believe every dataset can tell a story if you shape it right.  
✨ I mix marketing intuition with analytical precision.  
✨ My dashboards focus on **clarity, emotion, and visual flow**, not just numbers.

**Data should feel alive, engaging, and meaningful.**  
And that’s exactly how I approach it.

## 🤣 Data Memes (because creativity needs humour)

- “Let me clean this dataset real quick…” — *famous last words*  
- Excel when you forget to save: **You’re on your own, babe.**  
- Power BI refresh: *loading… loading… still loading… spiritually loading…*  
- SQL: *Where one missing comma can ruin your entire mood.*
